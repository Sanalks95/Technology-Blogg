    <h1>What is Angular ?</h1>
    <p>Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. Angular is a Single Page Application Framework which is used for creating Fast Web Applications. It uses concepts of SPA in which UI is delivered in the beginning of application request and later only data is requested which makes SPA applications fast.</p>
    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <h2>Naming</h2>
    <P>The rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the Team announced that separate names should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.</P>
